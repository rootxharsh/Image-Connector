# Product Description & Purpose

Power dynamic site search by syncing your Image Media Types from Drupal to Yext.
Drupal is a free, open-source content management system with a large, supportive
community. It is used by millions of people and organizations around the globe
to build and maintain their websites. Each media type connector will pull in a
different media type, so you will have to download multiple if you would like to
pull in Documents or Videos.

The Drupal Image Connector automatically syncs your Image data to Yext on a
daily basis. Any time you add, update, or remove an Image media type in Drupal,
these same changes will occur in Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your
Drupal data even further to power Yext search experiences!

This app creates the following custom connectors:

- xdImage_imageConnector

This app creates the following custom entity type that correlates to the custom
connector:

- xdImage_image

This app creates the following custom fields:

- xdImage_createdDate
- xdImage_creator

This app also adds two plugins, extractFileUrl and getUser.
